# **A Quick Intro to Web3** 

## 🕸️🕸️🕸️

---

## **We're going to cover** 📝

- A super fast history of the web
- Web3 Definitions
- Web3 Key players
- And Web3 Use cases

---

## **Before we Talk about Web3** 🤓

---

## **Web 1 and Web 2**

---

## **Let's Look at What made Each Era Possible ⛵**

---

## **Web 1: Static Web** 🪨

- Internet
- HTML
- HTTP
- More...

##### Resulting in Websites

---

## **Web 2: Interactive Web** 🚗

- Centralized Databases (SQL)
- Javascript
- AJAX
- More...

##### Resulting in Web Apps

---

## **Web 3: Decentralized Web** 🚀

- Made possible by one revolutionary technology

---

## **Blockchain** 🧱 ⛓️

- A decentralized network of computers that records verifiable copies of the same data. And populated by anyone on the network.
- Put simply, blockchains are secure insofar as the network is large enough, dispersered enough, and designed well enough to incentize good actor behavior over bad.
- It was introduced by Bitcoin (As a single-purpose protocol that supports one app, transfering money)

---

## **And Web3 was born** 👶

- But Web3 didn't really feel like much when all you could do was one thing
- Imagine the web today if all you could do was send emails. 
- No that would not do. Because we want more. We want websites, we want web apps, we want all sorts of things. And we don't know what those things are yet.
- Luckily that's where the concept of decentralized applications (dapps) comes into play.

---

## **Dapps** 🤜

- Dapps are apps that live and run on blockchains
- Which make it possible to not only decentralize data on blockchains but also to decentralize compute on those networks. 
- Introduced by Ethereum (the first decentralized dapp blockchain)
- Making it possible to have the equivalent of a decentralized app store with no gate keepers, no censorship

---

## **Stay with me 😅**

- I know this is super abstract still
- Let's talk about the last piece

---

## **The Centralization of Decentralization** 🚱

- Web 1 became centralized because people didn't want to host their own servers
- Web 3 is becoming centralized for the same reason. Ethereum and others live largely on AWS which defeats the purpose. Effectively AWS is a point of failure and censorship.
- Additionally websites front-ends and assets lives largely on AWS.

---

## **Decentralized Cloud Infastructure** 🌐

- Decentralized infastructure solves this
- By enabling anyone to deploy their blockchain platforms, website frontends and static assets on the equivalent of a decentralized AWS
- First introduced by Dfinity as The Internet Computer

---

## **That Was a lot. Why does it matter? 🤔**

---

## **Maybe it doesn't. Unless** 🤷

- You want to own your data instead of Meta and Google.
- You want to control your money instead of the government and banks (eg. 2008 and now) where the banks profit from your money while the gov devalues it via inflation
- You value competition over monopolies that result from the centralized aggregation of power
- You like the idea of widely available opportunities regardless of where you live in the world
- Or if you happen to think freedom is a cool concept

--- 

## **Assuming you care🌬️**

---

## **Let's look at the use cases 🌴**

I barely touched the surface but I need to keep this high level

---

##  **El Salvador uses the US Dollar 🏖️**

- El Salvador used the US Dollar as legal tender.
- Which is great and stable in the short-term.
- But long-term it kind of sucks if the US prints a bunch of money to help the US population.
- Yeah, everyone who holds the US Dollar loses purchasing power. But at least US citizens (ideally) benefit from it. El Salvador kind of just takes the L.
- And the US Dollar loses value over time. 
- It's a lose or lose situation. El Salvador is stuck...

---

##  **Or El Salvador uses Bitcoin 🏖️**

- El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender (true story).
- Kind of sucks that Bitcoin is volitile right now in the short-term
- But long-term its trending up. And has outperformed every major asset class in the last decade.
- You can't print more Bitcoin once the cap is reached. Transaprent. And adoption is skyrocketing. Simle supply and demand.
- It's a lose or win big situation and El Salvador's GDP increased by double digits since making this change

##  How I want to see Web3 impact the world

- My vision statement on next slide. Competition etc.

---

##  How you can join the movement

- Read some books
- Learn solidity 
- Buy some crypto to get a feel for it
- Start contributing to Web3 ecosystems
