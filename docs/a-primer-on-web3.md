# **A Quick Intro to Web3** 

## 🕸️🕸️🕸️

---

**There will be typos. Ran short on time**

---

## **We're going to cover** 📝

- A super fast history of the web
- Web3 definitions
- Web3 key players
- Web3 use cases
- Q&As

---

## **Before we Talk about Web3** 🤓

---

## **Know that Web3 is Political** 🧑‍⚖️

- It's impossible to talk about Web3 without politics
- Not right vs left
- But political in the sense that it is all about the conversion of centralized power into decentralized power. Where there is power, there are politics
- Web3 is about making centralized institutions unneeded where  possible by replacing trusted intermediaries with technology that does not require trust to operate
- Forcing monopolies to compete for their users

## **Still here? 😅**

## **Web 1 and Web 2**

![w:400px](assets/thing-1-2.png)

---

## **Let's Look at What made Each Era Possible ⛵**

---

## **Web 1: Static Web** 🪨

- Internet
- HTML
- HTTP
- More...

##### Resulting in Websites

---
💡
##### **Someone publishes content. We all read it and the web experience does not change**

---

## **Web 2: Interactive Web** 🚗

- Centralized Databases (SQL)
- Javascript
- AJAX
- More...

##### Resulting in Web Apps

---

💡
##### **We all publish content. We all see different things and influence how the web experience changes**

---

## **Web 3: Decentralized Web** 🚀

- Made possible by one revolutionary technology
- Blockchain

---

💡
##### **We each own our data on the web, monetize the platforms we use, and move freely between platforms with our data and digital stuff**

---

## **Blockchain** 🧱 ⛓️

- A decentralized network of computers that records verifiable copies of the same data. And is populated by anyone on the network who pays the fee.
- Put simply, blockchains are secure insofar as the network is large enough, dispersered enough, and designed well enough to incentize good actor behavior over bad.
- It was introduced by Bitcoin (As a single-purpose blockchain that supports one app, transfering money)

---

## **Blockchain Made Web 3 Possible** 

- But Web3 didn't really feel like much when all you could do was one thing
- Imagine the web today if all you could do was send emails. 
- No that would not do. Because we want more. We want websites, we want web apps, we want all sorts of things. And we don't know what those things are yet.
- Luckily that's where the concept of decentralized applications (dapps) came into play.

---

## **Dapps** 🤜

- Dapps are apps that live and run on blockchains
- Which make it possible to not only decentralize data on blockchains but also to decentralize compute on those networks. 
- Introduced by Ethereum (the first dapp blockchain, or general purpose blockchain)
- Making it possible to have the equivalent of a decentralized app store with no gate keepers, no censorship, no apple. It's the people's app store.

---

## **Stay with me 😅**

- I know this is super abstract
- Let's talk about one more area

---

## **The Centralization of Decentralization** 🚱

- Web 1 and Web 2 became centralized because people didn't want to host their own servers
- Web 3 is becoming centralized for the same reason. Ethereum and others live largely on AWS which defeats the purpose. Effectively AWS is a point of failure and censorship.
- Additionally website front-ends and assets lives largely on AWS even if the backend is on a blockchain

---

## **Decentralized Cloud Infastructure** 🌐

- Decentralized cloud infastructure solves this
- By enabling anyone to deploy their blockchain nodes, website frontends, and static assets on the equivalent of a decentralized AWS that's owned by the masses
- First introduced by Dfinity as The Internet Computer
- We won't talk about that much more today but I did want you to know that it existed

---

## **That Was a lot. Why does it matter? 🤔**

---

## **It matters if** 🤷

- You want to own your data instead of Meta and Google.
- You want to control your money instead of the government and banks (eg. 2008) where the banks use our money to centralize their profits but socialize their losses. And the US government inflates our dollar
- You value competition over monopolies that result from the centralized aggregation of power
- You like the idea of widely available opportunities regardless of where you live in the world
- Or if you just happen to think freedom is a cool concept

--- 

## **Assuming you care🌬️**

---

## **Let's look at the use cases 🌴**

I barely touched the surface but I need to keep this high level

---

##  **El Salvador uses the US Dollar 🏖️**

- El Salvador uses the US Dollar as legal tender.
- Which is great and stable in the short-term.
- But long-term it kind of sucks if the US prints a bunch of money to help the US population.
- Everyone in the world who holds the US Dollar loses purchasing power. But at least US citizens (ideally) benefit from it. El Salvador kind of just takes the L.
- Additionally the US Dollar loses value over time. 
- It's a lose or lose situation. El Salvador is stuck...

---

##  **Or El Salvador uses Bitcoin 🏖️**

- They made Bitcoin legal tender (true story).
- Kind of sucks that Bitcoin is volitile right now in the short-term
- But long-term its trending up. And has outperformed every major asset class in the last decade.
- You can't print more Bitcoin once the cap is reached. Transparent. And adoption is skyrocketing. Simple supply and demand. The value of Bitcoin goes up.
- It's a lose or win big situation and El Salvador's GDP increased by double digits since making this change

##  **Send Money to England with a bank 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿**

- I want to send money to my sweet Grandmother
- With the traditional banking system, they say no problem
- $60 fee - 1-5 days - and not on the weekend

---

##  **OR Send Money to England with Bitcoin 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿**

- I want to send money to my sweet Grandmother
- Less than $1 fee - 30 minutes - Whenever I want

---

##  **Put money in a Savings account :monkey:**

- The bank gives me 0.05% interest
- The bank makes all the profit lending out my money

---

##  **OR Put money in a DeFI Lending App on Ethereum 🦍**

- The app gives me 5% interest
- There is no third party profiting from my money.
- Just autonomous code on the Ethereum blockchain

---

##  **They own your digital stuff 😲**

- You buy digital gear in your games and Sony owns it
- You post photos on Facebook and they own it
- You want to leave whatever service you've been on but don't because you can't take your data

---

##  **OR you own your digital stuff as NFTs 😄**

- Put simply, NFTs are a record of who owns digital data that lives on a Blockchain
- You buy digital gear in your games but that gear lives on the blockchain and is owned by you
- You post photos to Facebook but that photo lives on the blockchain and is owned by you
- You move elsewhere whenever you want and grant the new platforms access to your digital stuff (NFTs)

---

##  **Use Chrome and they profit from your data**

😑

---

##  **Use Brave and you profit from your data 🤑**

- The Brave Browser asks you if you want to be advertised to
- Using Ethereum, they pay you a share of the cut everytime you see an ad

---

## **There's so much more 🛩️**

But let's land the plane.

---

##  **The Impact I want to see**

- Is a world where every centralized power has decentralized competition
- Is a USA that does not print as much money because Bitcoin is next door
- Is a world where Meta not be evil because Decentra-Social is next door
- Is a world where previous location-based opportunities become open to anyone on earth. That's already happening

---

##  **If you're curious**

- Read some books (The Bitcoin Standard, The Infinite Machine)
- On Udemy, check out Master Ethereum & Solidity Programming From Scratch by Andrei Dumitrescu
- Buy some crypto to get a feel for it (Coinbase)
- Start contributing to Web3 ecosystems (GitCoin)

---

# **In Closing 💤**

- That was a lot
- Technology is eating the world but if we don't change something technology will continue to centralize it. Esecially as AI grows faster and faster. It will happen. Who should own it. Central powers or the world collectively?
- Web3 decentralizes power and fights back against continued aggregation of more of it from Governments, companies, and institutions
- Thanks for your time
