#### Vision blast off 2022 🚀

## When I think about a name for 2021 🤔

---

## **I think of it as: The year we got ready ⚡**

## **We also spent a lot last year 🤑**

- And lost a lot of money.
- And folks got really tired
- And we didn't get enough wins

---

# <!--fit--> 🐘

---

## **But it's a new year** 💪

- We're still here
- We still want to win
- We're stronger than ever
- We have a plan to absolutely crush it
- And WE ARE READY

---

## **Will this plan work? 🤷‍♂️**

It's impossible to be certain.

---

## **But this is our moment to pull no punches 👊**

We're going to:

- Sell our marketing services at a premium
- Productize our API integrations
- And end the year profitable (w/out factoring in SMI)

---

## **Big goals, how do we meet them?**

The same way the best teams always do:

- We maintain a high tempo
- We relentlessly prioritize those goals

---

## **What is a high tempo? ⏩**

- **High tempo:** What can I do today or this week? Iterative, meaningful progress fast, with a short feedback loop so we can learn and improve and capitalize on our investment today, not next month or next quarter.
- **Low tempo:** We'll try that next month. All or nothing progress slow, where we do too much at once and take too long to move towards our goal.

---

## **What is relentless prioritization 🦸‍♂️?**

- **Relentless priorization:** How does that get us closer to one of our specific goals? If not, maybe we consider that next year?
- **Fuzzy prioritization:** That's not one of our goals but let's try it! I have some spare cycles.

---

## **We've got to make a profit 💰**

Because:

- It keeps our team healthy
- A healthy team better executes on our mission for our customers
- A healthy team can innovate for humanity and look around the corner, knowing that today and tomorrow are secure.

---

## **And this is the year we win** 🏅

---

## **Once again, the goals are** 🥅

- Sell our marketing services at a premium
- Productize our API integrations
- End the year profitable (w/out factoring in SMI)

---

## **And the principles are** 💡

- High tempo
- Relentless prioritization

---

## **And we can absolutely crush it** 💪
## **Because WE ARE READY**
