# **A Quick Intro to Web3** 

## 🕸️🕸️🕸️

---

## We're going to cover

- Foundational tech in Web 1 through Web 3
- Web3 Definitions and key players

---

## Before we Talk about Web3 🤓

---

## Web 1 and Web 2

## **Looking at Foundational Technologies 🏗️**

---

## Web 1: Static Web 🪨

- Internet
- HTML
- HTTP
- Websites
- Decentralized Infrastructure

---

## Web 2: Interactive Web 🚗

- Centralized Databases (SQL)
- Javascript
- AJAX
- Web Apps
- Centralized Infrastructure (Cloud providers)

---

## Web 3: Decentralized Web 🚀

- Decentralized Databases (Blockchains)
- Decentralized Applications (Dapps)
- Decentralized Infrastructure 

---

## Blockchain 🧱 ⛓️

- Introduced by Bitcoin (a single-purpose protocol that supports one app, transfering money)
- A decentralized network of computers that records verifiable copies of the same data

---

## Dapps 🤜

- Introduced by Ethereum (a blockchain that supports an unlimited number of apps created by anyone)
- Apps that live on and run on a blockchain

---

## Decentralized Infastructure 🌐

- Introduced by Dfinity as The Internet Computer (a decentralized cloud provider)
- Web 1 became centralized because people don't want to host their own servers
- Web 3 is becoming centralized for the same reason. Ethereum and others live largely on AWS
- Websites front-ends and assets lives largely on AWS.
- Decentralized Infrastructure like the Internet Computer solves this

## **Why does it matter? 🤔**

---

## Maybe it doesn't. Unless 🤷

- You want to own your data instead of Meta, Google, and Amazon
- You don't want the government and banks controlling and manipulating your money (eg. 2008 and now)
- You value competition over monopolies resulting from the centralized aggregation of power
